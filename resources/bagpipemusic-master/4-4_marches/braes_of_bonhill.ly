        who taught the first members of The Murray Pipes & Drums,
        such as Mats, Martin, Frank, Ulf, and Sven in the 1970â€™s.
        Jimmy used to live at Bonhill, but he later moved his home
        and pipe making shop to a place one mile south of Luss.

        Jimmy died in August 1999. Mats and Sven were in Scotland
        at the time with the intention to visit Jimmy, but instead
        got to attend his funeral in Bonhill."
